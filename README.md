# CN-SAMF
This is a C++ implementation of the visual tracking method proposed in [1]
The implementation is built upon the code provided by [2][3][4]. The code provided by [5] is used for computing the color name representation.

Instructions:
1.Modify the base_path in "run_tracker.m" with your own setting.
2.Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
3.Choose sequence.
